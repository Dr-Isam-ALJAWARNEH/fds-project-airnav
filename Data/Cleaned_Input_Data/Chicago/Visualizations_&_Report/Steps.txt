Below is an example Google Colab notebook cell that uses the datascience Table (along with conversion to a pandas DataFrame) to produce several visualizations for numeric and categorical columns and then prints a summary report. You can run this cell after youâ€™ve merged and cleaned your data into a datascience Table named merged_table.

Explanation
Data Conversion:
The datascience merged_table is converted into a pandas DataFrame to simplify plotting and summary computations.

Column Identification:
The script defines a helper function to identify columns as numeric if at least half their values can be converted to numbers; the remainder are treated as categorical.

Visualizations:

Numeric Columns: Histograms are generated for each numeric column using matplotlib.

Categorical Columns: Bar charts display the top 5 most frequent values for each categorical column.

Text Report:
A detailed summary report is printed, including:

Overall row and column counts.

For numeric columns: count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum.

For categorical columns: the number of unique values and the top 5 most frequent values.

Run this cell in your Google Colab environment (after merging/cleaning your data) to generate the visualizations and the report summary.
