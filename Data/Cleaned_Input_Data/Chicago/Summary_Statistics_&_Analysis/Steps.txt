Below is an example Google Colab notebook cell that assumes you’ve already merged and cleaned your dataset into a datascience Table named merged_table (from the previous merging step). This code computes summary statistics for numeric columns and shows frequency counts for non‐numeric columns.

Explanation
Numeric Columns:
For each column where at least half the entries can be converted to a number, the script computes:

Count: Number of numeric entries

Mean: Average value

Standard Deviation: Measure of dispersion

Min/Max: Minimum and maximum values

Median, Q1, Q3: Central tendency and quartile values

Categorical/Text Columns:
For columns that are not predominantly numeric, the code displays the top five most common entries along with the total number of unique values.

Overall Data Summary:
The total number of rows and columns in the merged dataset is printed first, followed by the summary for each column.

Run this cell in your Google Colab notebook (after merging and cleaning your data) to get an overview of your dataset’s summary statistics.
