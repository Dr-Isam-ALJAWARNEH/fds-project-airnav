How It Works
Google Colab Upload:
The script starts by importing the file upload module from Google Colab. When you run it, you’ll be prompted to upload all your CSV files.

Loading Data:
Each uploaded file is read into a datascience Table. The file names are sorted so that they’re processed in order if that matters.

Merging Data:
The Tables are combined vertically using Table.vstack(*tables), which works when each file shares the same column structure.

Cleaning:

Standardizing Column Names: The column names are stripped of extra spaces and converted to lowercase.

Removing Duplicates: Duplicate rows are removed via the built-in unique() method.

Removing Fully Empty Rows: Rows where every cell is missing (empty or None) are filtered out.

Trimming String Values: For every cell that is a string, extra spaces are removed.

Saving the Result:
Finally, the cleaned merged dataset is saved as a CSV file.

This code should run in a Google Colab notebook. Just ensure you upload all your CSV parts when prompted, and the cleaned dataset will be saved in your Colab environment.
